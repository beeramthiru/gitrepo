How Do I Connect To A Github Repository Using SSH ?

Issue
Setup SSH keys for use with GitHub.

Resolution
Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. For that you need to follow below steps:

Generate a new SSH key:

Raw
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account settings :

Raw
Copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your SSH keys in your 
GitHub account Settings
Test SSH key:

Raw
$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi developius! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:

Raw
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:

Raw
$ git commit -am "Update README.md"
$ git push
You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.
